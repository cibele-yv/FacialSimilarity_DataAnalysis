# FacialSimilarity_DataAnalysis
This project aims to improve the KYC (Know your customer) process through exploratory and Facial Similarity Analisys.

Each prospective customer has to go through a Know Your Customer (KYC) process by submitting a government-issued photo ID and a facial picture, then would perform 2 checks:

• Document check: To verify that the photo ID is valid and authentic;
• Facial Similarity check: To verify that the face in the picture is the same with that on the submitted ID.

The customer will ‘pass’ the KYC process and get onboarded if the results of both Document and Facial Similarity checks are ‘clear’. If the result of any check is not ‘clear’, the customer has to submit all the photos again.

The “pass rate” is defined as the number of customers who pass both the KYC process divided by the number of customers who attempt the process. Each customer has up to 2 attempts.
The pass rate has decreased substantially in the recent period.
